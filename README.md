# Business Website Template

Hi! Here is a business company website template for the [Replit Template Jam 2022](https://blog.replit.com/template-jam)! 

It's a template for a website which you can use to present a company. This website contains lots of sections like landing, features, about, pricing, testimonials, and so much more! It's also completely responsive, meaning that you can view it on any device; computer, tablet or phone!

The general style of this site is meant to be serious and transparent about its practices, with some contrast between the angular elements and wavy decorations. A more in-depth case study of the features and design is [available here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/134790531/Urban).
